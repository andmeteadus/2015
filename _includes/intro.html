<p>Poole is the butler for <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the static site generator. It’s designed and developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a> to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site. It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example templates, pages, posts, and styles.</p>

<p>There are currently two themes built on Poole:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com">Lanyon</a></li>
</ul>
